# Data Structures Problems

There are 6 different exercises here, each with each python file containing the solution and also its time and space complexity analysis markdown file:

The problems are the following:

1- Active Directory user lookup by means of a recursive search, since the tree structure of AD means that groups can contain users, but also subgroups

2- BlockChain implementation using linked lists and hashing to set the next attribute of current node

3- Huffman Encoder and Decoder for any string

4- Intersection and Union method of linked lists

5- Least Recently used Cache

6- Finding a file in a filesystem using recursion
